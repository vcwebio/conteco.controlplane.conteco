# controlplane.conteco
#
# A controlplane gives access to an API that consists of 7 sections: console, repo, config, build, release, deploy and run.
# Not all controlplanes require the full API for their operations.
#
# The conteco controlplane manages the container ecosystem, creating structures of interacting containers.
# This includes management of the wrapper functionality and the configuration of the container applications.
# It generates the stack docker-compose.yml and environment settings, ready for ModEco module creation.
#
# It provides full implementation for repo, build, release and deploy and partial implementation of config and console.
# There is no implementation for run.
#
# Each to level API method implements the --info flag returning information relevant to the API method about the image.
